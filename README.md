Instapaper-to-PDF is a simple script that prints PDFs of your Instapaper items.

### Requirements
You will need [HTMLDOC](http://www.htmldoc.org) installed in order to utilize this script.

To install on OS X via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/): `brew install htmldoc`.

Please review the official documentation for installation on other platforms.


### Usage
Set your username, password, and desired path for saved PDFs in "instapaper\_to\_pdf.rb". Then run:

    ruby instapaper-to-pdf.rb


Importing to DEVONthink and deleting articles from Instapaper after print are disabled by default. Uncomment the respective lines to enable them.
